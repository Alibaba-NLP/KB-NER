# ITA: Image-Text Alignments for Multi-Modal Named Entity Recognition

The code is for our NAACL 2022 paper: [ITA: Image-Text Alignments for Multi-Modal Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06482.pdf).

**I**mage-**T**ext **A**lignments (ITA) aligns image features into the textual space so that the textual transformer-based embeddings can be fully utilized to model the interactions between images and texts.

The code and instructions will be released soon.
